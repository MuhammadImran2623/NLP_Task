# Text emotions classification is the problem of assigning emotion to a text by understanding the context and the emotion behind the text.
* Developed a machine learning model to classify
 emotions from text data. 
* Handled null values and applied tokenizer
 methods for text preprocessing.
* Utilized techniques like one-hot
 encoding,
* Implemented a neural network architecture using Keras.
